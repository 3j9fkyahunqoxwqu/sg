# The WHATWG Steering Group

The purpose of the Steering Group is to govern and guide the WHATWG, an open, efficient forum for
development of Living Standards (useful technical specifications, with intellectual property
commitments from contributors) plus associated documentation, code, and other
materials and activities that relate to or support web technologies, as determined by the Steering
Group.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is intended for Steering Group discussion, and also as
a record of Steering Group decisions. The recommended way to make
requests to the Steering Group is to file an issue in this repostiroy.

In addition, this repository holds all WHATWG Policies, and a record
of existing Workstreams and Living Standards.
